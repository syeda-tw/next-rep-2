# Next-Rep-2 Coding Challenge: Second Attempt

This repository contains the second attempt for the coding challenge **Next-Rep-2**. It is built using **Next.js 15** with **Clerk.js** for authentication and **ShadCN components** for styling.

---

## Features
- **Framework:** Next.js 15  
- **Authentication:** Clerk.js  
- **Styling:** ShadCN Components  

---

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd next-rep-2
```
### 2. Use NVM (Node Version Manager)
To ensure you are using the LTS version of Node.js, follow these steps with NVM:
- Install NVM (if not already installed) by following the instructions here.
- Install the LTS version:
```bash
nvm install --lts
```
- Use the LTS version:
```bash
nvm use --lts
```
This will set the LTS version of Node.js as your active version.
### 3. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have `npm` or `yarn` installed. Use the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### 4. Add Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project and add the following keys:
```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```
Replace `your_clerk_publishable_key` and `your_clerk_secret_key` with the keys provided by Clerk.
### 5. Run the Development Server
Start the development server with the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Explaination of Choices
1. Next 15
We are using Next 15, the latest stable release of Next.js, to take advantage of the latest features, optimizations, and improvements that it offers.
2. Folder Structure
- Authentication Pages: Pages related to user authentication (like login, signup) are placed in the auth folder for easy separation and management.
- Signed-In Pages: Pages accessible after users log in are stored in the pages folder, maintaining clarity and logical organization.
- Page-Specific Components: Each page has its own dedicated folder with the essential components needed specifically for that page. This makes it easy to maintain and scale the app in the future.
- Reusable Components: Common components (buttons, inputs, etc.) that are used throughout the app are stored in the components folder, ensuring reusability and avoiding redundancy.
3. ShadCN Integration
- The UI components are generated by ShadCN for fast development and consistent design. These components are customized in their respective components/app-componentname file to ensure the flexibility of the code.
- ShadCN’s default style is used for efficiency, but the components are tailored when needed. This allows for easy updates from the ShadCN library while maintaining custom design adjustments.
- Loading Bar: A loading bar is integrated using ShadCN to enhance the user experience during page transitions.
4. Sidebar Layout
- The sidebar is incorporated at the layout level, so it is automatically included in all signed-in pages, providing a consistent navigation experience across the app.
- This reduces repetition of sidebar code across different pages and ensures a unified structure.
5. Modular Architecture
- The structure is designed to be modular and scalable. Each component is isolated in its own folder and can be updated independently, making future changes and debugging easier.
- This structure enables the app to grow with minimal overhead and keeps the codebase organized.
6. Aesthetic Design
- For consistency and faster development, we are using the default ShadCN aesthetic with minimal customizations. This allows us to focus on core functionality and save time, while still providing a visually appealing user interface.
- The ShadCN framework offers a clean, modern design by default, which fits well with the app’s requirements.
